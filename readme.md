# node-4ch readme and major notes

## Readme
Most of the interesting stuff is in 4ch_sequelize.js

4ch_sequelize_database contains the Sequelize table definitions and setup

This code is not currently designed for use outside a code editing environment.

(I use Visual Studio code to write and run this.)

Try to keep requests below 1 per second (per 4chan's guidelines).
